        - Market references ("inside [mall name] food court", "stall in", "vendor at", "farmer's market", "flea market", "night market")
        - Address information mentioned in hashtags or location descriptions
        - Mall, plaza, or market names that contain the individual vendors

        **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
        - For popups: Set is_popup=true and fill popup_details
        - For area guides: Set content_type="area_guide" and fill area_info
        - If no clear location info: Return empty places array
        - Use exact JSON format - no extra text or explanations
        - Extract specific menu items, not generic descriptions
        - Look for temporal indicators like "this weekend", "popup", "limited time"
        - DO NOT return generic names like "unnamed", "unknown", "restaurant", "cafe", "store", "business", etc.
        - Only return specific, identifiable business names with actual place names
        - If only generic descriptions are available, return the name as "establishment in location" (e.g., "Korean restaurant in Flushing")
        - ALWAYS extract Chinese/non-English place names - they are valid specific business names
        - For market vendors WITH specific names: Use the actual vendor name and include market address
        - For market vendors WITHOUT specific names: Format as directional location (e.g., "Corner Stall at Golden Mall Food Court", "Stand 5 at Union Square Farmer's Market", "Booth A12 at Brooklyn Flea")
        - When market/mall address is mentioned, use that as the address for individual vendors
        - Look for location clues in hashtags, descriptions, and üìç location pins
